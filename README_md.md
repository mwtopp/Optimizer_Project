# Optimizer_Project

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to develop a resource optimizer for a local authority housing department or similar organisation.
A housing department will typically have a large number of potential jobs, these will be of various types and are likely to be assigned differing priorities.
There are various resource constraints limiting the housing department's capability to undertake all the potential jobs; available funding, staffing, contractor capacity.
The objective of the optimizer is to maximize the number of jobs to be undertaken within the given period, weighted by priority.

## Conclusions
This project is relatively simple, however it provides proof of concept for the optimization method. Further iterations could increase the complexity of the model and thereby increase the value it provides to an organisation.
This project demonstrates the value of testing and tuning the model. Understanding the goals of the organisation and ensuring that the model results are consistent with them is vital if the model is going to provide value. 
Possible adjustments to the model include:
Defining the budget and staff constraints as soft constraints.
Including other constraints.
Allowing more customisation of the potential jobs, for example some jobs may be smaller or larger than a typical job of the same type.
